# AI for the Arts and Humanities: Learning Portfolio

## Project Overview
This repository documents my progression through the "AI for the Arts and Humanities" course. [cite_start]Unlike traditional computer science streams, the focus here is on **reading** code, interpreting algorithms, and critiquing the human-centric and social implications of Artificial Intelligence[cite: 7, 9].

## Learning Objectives
* [cite_start]**Demystifying Code:** Developing the ability to read and explain Python code to a non-technical Arts and Humanities audience[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**AI-Assisted Development:** Utilizing tools like GitHub Codespaces and AI assistants (Microsoft Copilot) to accelerate understanding of programming concepts[cite: 51].
* [cite_start]**Critical Reflection:** engaging with the ethical, cultural, and social dimensions of machine learning pipelines and Large Language Models (LLMs)[cite: 9, 770].

## Repository Structure
* **`coding_exercises.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing distinct sections on Python basics (variables, functions, loops) and multimedia processing (images, audio).
* **`Machine-Learning-Workflow.ipynb`**: A critical walkthrough of a standard ML pipeline with reflections on data usage.
* **`LLM_Design_Concept.md`**: A conceptual design proposal for a creative AI application, discussing architecture and social impact.

## Tools Used
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* GitHub Codespaces
* Libraries: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `librosa`
