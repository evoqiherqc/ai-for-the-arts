# AI for the Arts and Humanities: A Critical Portfolio
**Author:** [INSERT GUID HERE]

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a digital portfolio exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and the Humanities. It documents a journey from basic Python literacy to the critical analysis of Machine Learning pipelines and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Portfolio Structure
This body of work is organized into three core components, designed to be read in sequence:

### 1. Foundational Skills (`coding_exercises.ipynb`)
A documentation of my progression in "reading code." This notebook demonstrates:
* **Python Fundamentals:** Variables, functions, and control flow.
* **Multimedia Processing:** The technical and ethical handling of image and audio data (including licensing and attribution).
* **Library Exploration:** Practical engagement with `pandas` and `scikit-learn` for data structuring.

### 2. Critical Machine Learning (`Machine-Learning-by-Example...ipynb`)
A deep-dive into a standard ML workflow (Housing Regression & MNIST Classification). This notebook features:
* **The "Curatorial Filter":** An analogy explaining ML models to museum professionals.
* **Social Impact Analysis:** Critical reflections on "Omitted Variable Bias" (e.g., the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry crisis) and the risks of "Sanitization" in cultural datasets.
* **Technical Experiments:** Neural Network architecture testing via Tensorflow Playground.

### 3. Conceptual Design (`LLM_Design_Proposal.ipynb`)
A proposal for the **"Socratic Sparring Partner,"** an AI application designed to combat cognitive atrophy. This design prioritizes data sovereignty and neuroplasticity over passive consumption.

## Learning Objectives
* **Demystifying Code:** To translate technical concepts for a non-technical Arts audience.
* **Critical Integrity:** To scrutinize the "Black Box" of AI through the lens of Humanities ethics.
* **AI-Assisted Development:** To effectively utilize AI tools (Copilot) while maintaining human oversight.
